PSP Player is an emulator for Sony's [PlayStation Portable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable) handheld game system. It's developed exclusively in my spare time as a labor of hobby; this means that I won't support it, follow your demands, or (most importantly) sell it. At this point, everything is my creation with resources pulled from the PSP development community (see [Credits](Credits.md) for mad props). The code is available and you are welcome to use it for whatever purpose you desire, I just ask that you follow some simple [guidelines](CodeSharing.md).

If you're looking for support or more information, either join me in the #pspdev channel on FreeNode (as 'noxa'), or check out the Google groups.
